# UML - Class Diagram

Let's start the class diagram from the high-level and we will dig into low level.

On high-level there is two things we can see-

 * Class block - The Box Shape
 * Connecting line among the class

Based on the line type we can figure how the classed are connected with each other. Let's first go thorough different type line type.

## Line type

### 1. **Solid arrow line** is for **Inheritance**

![ Solid arrow line is for Inheritance](./diagram/inheritance.png)

The direction of the arrow is from child class to parent class. The arrow head is unfilled.
Just to put emphasis, the child class is just a specific type of parent class and can be replaced with one another.

### 2. **Broken arrow line** is for **Interface-Implementation class**
