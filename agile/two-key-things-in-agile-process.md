title: 2 + 3 Key elements for an effective Agile projects
---

There could be a number of activity that could make a project agile and
successful. However, there are two key elements which can drive all the other 
activities of a successful agile project. They are,

 1. Quick feedback loop from stakeholders
 2. Quick feedback loop from the team

Additional key point (Honorable Mention),

 3. Have vision and be on the same page about the vision
 4. Learn to take one step back to move faster
 5. Don't have to follow only 1 methodology.

##  1. Quick feedback loop from stakeholders

A very important criteria to be agile is to get feedback from the stakeholders
early and frequently and adapt based on the feedback.

### Issues with long wait time without any users

If an organization waits a long time to release a "perfect" feature or product, 
it can cause a lot of issues and business problems for the organization. Some
are,

 * It's easy to lose potential customers to competitors with long wait time.
 * When there is big bang release with so-called perfect product with many
   features, there is a high chance customers will find many faults, which will 
   make the customers very unhappy and angry.
 * The amount of waste increases with long wait time. So long wait time before
   going to the customers means a lot of assumptions are made. So there will be 
   number of features which customer will never use. Which is a form of waste.
 * Without any customer using a product and feedback, there are no checks and
   balance of the product. With each modification, there is always chance of
   including regression bugs and if it is unchecked with no feedback these
   regressions grows in unmaintainable proportion.

   This kind of regression cannot be caught with a QA team or tests. You do need
   real active users to catch this regression from feedbacks.

### How to get early feedback

Now let's discuss how we can actually get these early feedbacks. One of the best
ways to get early feedback is, releasing feature in a small **usable increment**
to the customers.  
Releasing in a small usable increment will resolve [the issues that are
discussed in the previous section](#issues-with-long-wait-time-without-any-users).
Moreover,

 * It is easy and faster to take a different approach when customers do not like
   an approach for an increment.
 * If stakeholders are happy with features, it becomes easy to work on the next
   best thing from the feedback and have a clear direction.
 * **The best one:** When users actually use a product, it gives the 
   team/organization a huge motivation to build the product even more.

Now two common questions regarding `small`, `usable` and `releasable` increment,
 * What if customer does not like a product when some features are missing
 * And, how to figure out what is a good `small`, `usable` and `releasable`
   increment

The first concerns is easier to address. In the beginning, the product is not 
needed to be opened to all customers. After finding the smallest usable and 
releasable increment and only a few customers can be onboarded at first.  
For example,  We can make something straightforward in 2 weeks to 1 month, and
release it to at least one customer. Moving forward, we can release new features
periodically, preferably each day to 2 weeks and gradually onboard more
customers along the way.

> Tip: You can try canary release with existing product with new features.

Now about the second concerns, how do we find the small releasable and usable
increment or some say `Minimum Viable Product (MVP)`?  
User Story Mapping is one of the best tool that can serve this purpose. User
story mapping a team exercise which helps an organization to figure out the
`Minimum Viable Product` or  `MVP` and also bring everyone to the same page.
You can check out this
[video about user story mapping by jeff Patton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AorAgSrHjKM&t=3s).  
There is also a book about user story mapping by **Jeff Patton** you can check
out.

## 2. Quick feedback loop for the team

Feedback loop for the `organization and team process` is as important as the
first [key element](#1-quick-feedback-loop-from-stakeholders). Adapting based on
feedbacks for the team helps the team to eliminate waste and become better and
efficient.  
One import note, Here the `team process` stands for how team members work
togather, interact with each other and share context.  
So it's about, `Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools`

### How to get feedback for the team
It is best when a team is autonomous and generate their own feedback. A team 
should have a cadence to figure out how to make the team better and what's 
slowing the team down. Retrospective is a great tool that can serve this purpose.
A good practice is to do retrospective frequently. Every team different so the every 1-2 week. 
Two things to make sure from this kind of team exercise,
 * Every team members should have the openspace to share their view and pain.
 * Find some measurable action items to make the team better.

Another good thing to do is a review way of work.
 
## Some honorable mention very important key point

### 3. Have a vision and share the vision across all

When building something new it is very important to have a common goal for an
organization. Once there is a common vision, the vision can drive goal for
different teams and the goal can be temporal too.

The vision should be transparent to everyone  in the org so that everyone and
every team can work towards to the same path and make their own goal with the
motivation from vision.

Onion planning and OKR is a great set of tools to derive goal, roadmap from 
vision and share them with everyone.

### 4. Learn to take one step back to move faster

It's very lovonio to keep working ignoring some issues that slowing a team down.
In the long run these issues adds up and cost more later.

Some example, 
 * In a team engineers work very fast, write a lot of but in silos, just as
   ninja. In long run since there are knowledge silos, for a different person it
   would ten times more time to modify the work. This could be avoided very easily
   by doing pair programming / mob programming.
 * Write code without test is another example. When code size grows it's become
   unmaintainable. Adding test would make the code more maintainable, and it would
   make refactoring easy.
 
Pair programming and writing does take a little time but the benefits outweigh
the cost in large scale when we see the big picture.

So in short, see the bigger picture and invest what will help the team or
organization in the long run.

### 5. Agile methodologies are not mutually exclusive

There are several type of agile methodologies for example, scrum, xp,...
There are some commonality and difference among these methodologies. However, 
They are not mutually exclusive. They are just a framework or path to start. We 
can include or exclude some practice from them.  
The most important thing is, start with something with the import key points in 
mind and then improve continuously.

> remove them.
