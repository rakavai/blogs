title: One of the two important key in agile process
---

These are two key things for an agile team.

 1. Quick feedback loop from stakeholders
 2. Quick feedback loop for the team

Additional
 3. Do not work in layer / set the higher level goal for all/ transparant about
    goal with everyone
 4. Not to be suboptimise
 5. Reduce waste
 6. Knwledge share
 7. Don't have to follow only 1 methodology.

##  1. Get quick feedback from stakeholders

A very important criteria to be agile is to get feedback from the stakeholders
early and frequently and adapt based on the feedback.

If an organization waits a long time to release a perfect feature, 
 * There are some risks of losing customers to competitors, 
 * With a big bang release, there is a high chance customers will find many
   faults, which will make the customers unhappy.
 * There will be many assumptions that most of the cases the end customers does
   not really want.
 * Team will work on something on assumption, which will be unused by the
   customer and that just a clear waste.
 * Without releasing to zero customer, there is no checks and balance of the
   product. With each time we modify code, there is high chance of including
   regression bugs which with time becomes very large.

One of the best ways to getting early feedback is, release feature in a small
chunk. One thing to note, the small releasable chunk needs to be **usable by the
customers**.  
Some benefits of getting feedback and releasing in a small chunk are,

 * It is easy and faster to take a different approach when customers do not like
   an approach for a feature.
 * If stakeholders are happy with features, it becomes easy to work on the next
   best thing from the feedback and have a clear direction for the whole
   organization.
 * The enormous benefit is reaching out to customers before competitors.
 * My personal favorite one is, when customer actually use a product, it gives
   the team motivation to build the product.

Some questions I heard about releasing in small chunk,
 * Customer will hate an org if we don't give the customers all the features
 * How to figure out what is a good minimum viable readable chunk

The first concerns is easier to fix. We don't need to open the product for all
the customers. We can find the smallest usable and releasable chunk and then
just onboard only a few customers. Make something straightforward, maybe in 2 
weeks to 1 month, and release it to at least one customer. Moving forward, 
release periodically, preferably each day to 2 weeks new features and gradually
onboard more customers.

> You can try canary release with existing product with new features.

Now about the second concerns, how do we find the small releasable chunk or 
minimum viable product?  
User Story Mapping is one of the best tool that can serve this purpose. User
story mapping a team exercise which helps an organization to figure out the MVP
and also bring everyone to the same page.

## 2. Quick feedback loop for the team

Feedback from the org and/or team and process is also as import as feedback from
the customers. This is the continues improvement for the way we will make the 
product. 

Being agile with team process is also very important like being agile with the
feature release. `How` is as important as `what`.
Using feedback for the team process also helps the team to
eliminate waste and find a better and efficient way of doing things. 
Having a cadence to figure out how to make the team better, what's slowing the team down.
A better approach could be having a do retrospective very frequently(every 1 week or 2 weeks) and
have measure action items out of them.


## 3. 

There are several type of agile methodologies. For example, scrum, xp,...
There are some common part in them and some different parts. You don't have to
follow them mutially exclusivley. The main thing about all of these agile method
is improvement, continues improvments. Here are some of the that helped a team
to become agile.

I think the very first thing that really helpful is to know the higher level goal
