title: One of the two important key in agile process
---

These are two key things for an agile team.

 1. Quick feedback loop from stakeholders
 2. Quick feedback loop for the team

Additional
 3. Have vision and be on the same page about the vision
 4. Learn to take one step back to move faster
 5. Don't have to follow only 1 methodology.

##  1. Get quick feedback from stakeholders

A very important criteria to be agile is to get feedback from the stakeholders
early and frequently and adapt based on the feedback.

If an organization waits a long time to release a perfect feature, 
 * There are some risks of losing customers to competitors, 
 * With a big bang release, there is a high chance customers will find many
   faults, which will make the customers unhappy.
 * There will be many assumptions that most of the cases the end customers does
   not really want.
 * Team will work on something on assumption, which will be unused by the
   customer and that just a clear waste.
 * Without releasing to zero customer, there is no checks and balance of the
   product. With each time we modify code, there is high chance of including
   regression bugs which with time becomes very large.

One of the best ways to getting early feedback is, release feature in a small
chunk. One thing to note, the small releasable chunk needs to be **usable by the
customers**.  
Some benefits of getting feedback and releasing in a small chunk are,

 * It is easy and faster to take a different approach when customers do not like
   an approach for a feature.
 * If stakeholders are happy with features, it becomes easy to work on the next
   best thing from the feedback and have a clear direction for the whole
   organization.
 * The enormous benefit is reaching out to customers before competitors.
 * My personal favorite one is, when customer actually use a product, it gives
   the team motivation to build the product.

Some questions I heard about releasing in small chunk,
 * Customer will hate an org if we don't give the customers all the features
 * How to figure out what is a good minimum viable readable chunk

The first concerns is easier to fix. We don't need to open the product for all
the customers. We can find the smallest usable and releasable chunk and then
just onboard only a few customers. Make something straightforward, maybe in 2 
weeks to 1 month, and release it to at least one customer. Moving forward, 
release periodically, preferably each day to 2 weeks new features and gradually
onboard more customers.

> You can try canary release with existing product with new features.

Now about the second concerns, how do we find the small releasable chunk or 
minimum viable product?  
User Story Mapping is one of the best tool that can serve this purpose. User
story mapping a team exercise which helps an organization to figure out the MVP
and also bring everyone to the same page.

## 2. Quick feedback loop for the team

Feedback on the org and/or team process is as import as feedback from the 
customers. Using feedback for the team process and acting on that helps the team
to eliminate waste and find a better and efficient way of doing things. One
import note, when we say team process, the important factors are about how team
work togather, interact with each other and share context.

A team should have a cadence to figure out how to make the team better and 
what's slowing the team down. Retrospective is a great tool that can serve this
purpose. A good practice is to do retrospective frequently, every 1-2 week. 
Two things to make sure from this kind of team exercise,
 * Every team members should have the openspace to share their view and pain.
 * Find some measurable action items to make the team better.
 
## Some honorable mention very important key point

### 3. Have a vision and share the vision across all

When building something new it is very important to have a common goal for an
organization. Once there is a common vision, the vision can drive goal for
different teams and the goal can be temporal too.

The vision should be transparent to everyone  in the org so that everyone and
every team can work towards to the same path and make their own goal with the
motivation from vision.

Onion planning and OKR is a great set of tools to derive goal, roadmap from 
vision and share them with everyone.

### 4. Learn to take one step back to move faster

It's very lovonio to keep working ignoring some issues that slowing a team down.
In the long run these issues adds up and cost more later.

Some example, 
 * In a team engineers work very fast, write a lot of but in silos, just as
   ninja. In long run since there are knowledge silos, for a different person it
   would ten times more time to modify the work. This could be avoided very easily
   by doing pair programming / mob programming.
 * Write code without test is another example. When code size grows it's become
   unmaintainable. Adding test would make the code more maintainable, and it would
   make refactoring easy.
 
Pair programming and writing does take a little time but the benefits outweigh
the cost in large scale when we see the big picture.

So in short, see the bigger picture and invest what will help the team or
organization in the long run.

> Today's convenience is tomorrow's bigger inconvenience.

> Sooner but not faster.

### 5. Agile methodologies are not mutually exclusive

Try new things and be agile to change that if it works or not.
There are several type of agile methodologies. For example, scrum, xp,...
There are some common part in them and some different parts. You don't have to
follow them mutially exclusivley. The main thing about all of these agile method
is improvement, continues improvments. Here are some of the that helped a team
to become agile.
