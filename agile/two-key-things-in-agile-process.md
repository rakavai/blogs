title: One of the two important key in agile process
---

There are several type of agile methodologies. For example, scrum, xp,...
There are some common part in them and some different parts. You don't have to
follow them mutially exclusivley. The main thing about all of these agile method
is improvement, continues improvments. Here are some of the that helped a team
to become agile.
These are two key things for an agile team.

 1. Get quick feedback from stakeholders
 2. Feedback loop for the team
 3. Do not work in layer / set the higher level goal for all/ transparant about
    goal with everyone
 4. Not to be suboptimise
 5. Reduce waste
 6. Knwledge share
 7. Don't have to follow only 1 methodology.

##  1. Get quick feedback from stakeholders

A very important criteria to be agile is to get feedback from the stakeholders
early and frequently and adapt based on the feedback.

If an organization waits a long time to release a perfect feature, 
 * There are some risks of losing customers to competitors, 
 * With a big bang release, there is a high chance customers will find many
   faults, which will make the customers unhappy.
 * There will be many assumptions that most of the cases the end customers does
   not really want.
 * Without releasing to zero customer, there is no checks and balance of the
   product. With each time we modify code, there is high chance of including
   regression bugs which with time becomes very large.

Some of the benefits of getting feedback and releasing in a small chunk are,

 * It is easy and faster to take a different approach when customers do not like
   a feature or product
 * If stakeholders are happy with features, it becomes easy to work on the next
   best thing from the feedback.
 * The enormous benefit is reaching out to customers before competitors.

With the periodic iterative release, we can interactively increase customers
numbers.

Do not wait for 100% perfect for a long time. Instead, make something
straightforward, maybe in 2 weeks to 1 month, and release it to at least one 
customer. Moving forward, release periodically, preferably each day to 2 weeks 
new features and open it to more customers.

But the question is, how do we find the small releasable chunk or minimum viable
product? User Story Mapping is a good tool that can serve this purpose. You can
check out this [video about user story mapping by jeff Patton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AorAgSrHjKM&t=3s).
There is also a book on user story mapping by Jeff Patton.

## 2. Feedback loop for the team

Being agile with team process is also very important like being agile with the
feature release. Using feedback for the team process also helps the team to
eliminate waste and find a better and efficient way of doing things. 
Having a cadence to figure out how to make the team better, what's slowing the team down.
A better approach could be having a do retrospective very frequently(every 1 week or 2 weeks) and
have measure action items out of them.

One of the common scenario I saw many times is, an organization wait for a perfect
product and work

I think the very first thing that really helpful is to know the higher level goal
