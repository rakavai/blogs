title: One of the two important key in agile process
---

These are two key things for an agile team.

 1. Get quick feedback from stakeholders
 2. Reduce waste

##  1. Get quick feedback from stakeholders

1.1 Get feedback
1.2 Adapt

The stakeholders can be anyone from internal or external. It is someone who have
values from the product you are making. Without feedbacks you are really making 
something for air with many assumption.

Get very quick feedback and based on that change the direction.

First thing first to get a quick feedback you will need to figure out the
releasable chunk. Very small things can serve some value to customer/customer
can use it and give you feedback.

Benefits of that:

 * If customer does not like the release then you can find other way
 * If they are happy with it then you can work on the next thing on it
 * You are actually reaching the customer before anyone

If you are planning for a big release and then relaised customer do not really
want it or someone else already serving the customer. You will actually loose
theese customer.

Now some time I hear It is hard to find out the releasable chunk. There are
some tools and technique. One of my favorite is **user story mapping**.

So once you have that release it is easy to get feedback.
